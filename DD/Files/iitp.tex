\subsection{Overview}
In this last section we provide all the necessary specifications about the plan for the implementation and the testing of the system. This phase is, of course, critical for the development of a reliable software system. It is important to observe that, while testing can show the presence of bugs in the code, passing the tests does not imply the absence of errors in the final application. Still, with our tests, we will try to find the majority of the bugs before the product hits the market (and also after, maintenance is important).

\subsection{Implementation Plan}
For all the implementation processes we have chosen a \textbf{bottom-up} approach; %TODO



The first element that we will implement is the DBMSServices component, which manages the model, i.e. the data, of our application, and so it is required by most of the components of the system.\\
After the data layer has been implemented we can proceed to the components that utilize it.
