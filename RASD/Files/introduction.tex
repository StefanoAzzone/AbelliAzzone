\subsection{Purpose}
The coronavirus emergency has put a strain on society on many levels, in  particular,  grocery  shopping can  become  a  challenge  in  the presence  of  such  strict  rules: supermarkets  need to  restrict  access  to  their  stores  to  avoid having  crowds  inside and long  lines outside. The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  develop  an  easy-to-use  application  that,  on  the  one  side,  allows  store managers  to  regulate  the  influx  of  people  in  the  building  and,  on  the  other  side,  saves  people  from having to line up and stand outside of stores for hours on end. \\\\
The application will allow customers to “line up” (i.e., retrieve a number) from their home, and then wait  until  their  number  is  called  (or  is  close  to  being  called)  to  approach  the  store.  In  addition,  the application could be used to generate QR codes that would be scanned upon entering the store, thus allowing store managers to monitor entrances.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item CLup should allow customers to queue up remotely
	\item CLup should allow store owners to monitor entrances
	\item CLup should provide the customer with a reasonably precise estimate of waiting time
	\item CLup should alert the customers when it is time to get to the shop taking into account travel time
	\item CLup should allow customers to book future visits to stores
	\item CLup should allow customers to specify estimated visit duration and desired objects
\end{enumerate}
