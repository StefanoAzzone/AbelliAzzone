\subsection{External interface requirements}
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
There are two categories of users that have different interface requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries Customers}\\
	Customers belong to all demographics so a user friendly interface is needed. The customer is presented with a main menu which allows him/her to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item line up immediately (immediate reservation) at a specific store
		\item book a visit (future reservation) at a specific store
		\item view and delete existing reservations
	\end{itemize}
	The customer will receive a notification when it is time for him/her to depart to reach the shop.\\\\
	\item {\bfseries Store owners}\\
	The store owner is presented with a main menu from which he/she can:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item register a store to the system
		\item delete a store from the system
		\item view and edit occupation for currently registered stores
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The S2B requires the following hardware interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bfseries Computer or smartphone}\\
	Users will need a computer or a smartphone to access the system's services which are provided via an application (only for smartphone owners) and a web application. Only users with an application will be able to receive notifications that alert them when it is time for them to depart and reach the store.
	\item {\bfseries Turnstiles}\\
	Turnstiles allow authorized customers to enter or exit the store by providing a means of identification. (i.e. QR, NFC)
	\item {\bfseries Ticket printer}\\
	The ticket printers located outside stores allows potential customers to queue up on premise provided that they identify themselves (e.g. social security card).
	\item \textbf{Monitor}\\
	A monitor located outside stores allows customers that queue up on premise to know when it is time for them to access the store.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The system uses a public API to locate the customer and provide him/her with notifications about the time he will need to depart to reach the store.

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
Customers can access the system through a working internet connection.
