\subsection{External interface requirements}
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
There are two categories of users that have different interface requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries Customers}\\
	Customers belong to all demographics so a user friendly interface is needed. The customer is presented with a main menu which allows him/her to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item line up immediately (immediate reservation) at a specific store
		\item book a visit (future reservation) at a specific store
		\item view and delete existing reservations
	\end{itemize}
	The customer will receive a notification when it is time for him/her to depart to reach the shop.\\\\

	\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Images/ShowReservations.png}
	\item {\bfseries Store owners}\\
	The store owner is presented with a main menu from which he/she can:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item register a store to the system
		\item delete a store from the system
		\item view and edit occupation for currently registered stores
	\end{itemize}

	\end{figure}
	
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
The S2B requires the following hardware interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bfseries Computer or smartphone}\\
	Users will need a computer or a smartphone to access the system's services which are provided via an application (only for smartphone owners) and a web application. Only users with an application will be able to receive notifications that alert them when it is time for them to depart and reach the store.
	\item {\bfseries Turnstiles}\\
	Turnstiles allow authorized customers to enter or exit the store by providing a means of identification. (i.e. QR, NFC)
	\item {\bfseries Ticket printer}\\
	The ticket printers located outside stores allows potential customers to queue up on premise provided that they identify themselves (e.g. social security card).
	\item \textbf{Monitor}\\
	A monitor located outside stores allows customers that queue up on premise to know when it is time for them to access the store.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
The system uses a public API to locate the customer and provide him/her with notifications about the time he will need to depart to reach the store.

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
Customers can access the system through a working internet connection.

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\subsubsection{List of requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[label=R\arabic*]
	\item Turnstiles unlock if and only if activated by authorized customers.
	\item The number of customers in the store never exceeds the occupation set by the owner.
	\item The monitor outside the store displays the number of the last authorized customer.
	\item The system allows customers and store owners to register and log in.
	\item The system validates the authenticity of the identifying information provided.
	\item The system allows customers to search for a store among those registered by their owners.
	\item Registered customers can send a reservation request to the system.
	\item On premise customers with an identifying document can send a reservation request to the system.
	\item Registered customers that book a visit can specify estimated visit duration.
	\item Registered customers that book a visit can specify desired product categories.
	\item The system provides customers with a QR code to enter the store once authorized.
	\item The system uses gathered data to build statistics. %TODO to ask.
	\item Registered customers with a smartphone are alerted when their turn is near.
	\item The system exchanges information with the printer.
	\item Registered customers can delete a pending or authorized reservation.
	\item After a reservation is authorized if it does not become current in a fixed time, it expires.
	\item Registered customers must specify desired means of transport while requesting a reservation.

	%TODO add that customers have a time window in which they can enter a store after which their reservation expires, otherwise the store could remain empty (limit case)
	
	%TODO pensare a come sistemare la faccenda dell'occupazione dei dipartimanti/massima

\subsubsection{Scenarios} %TODO: should they go to section 2 as assignment says?
\paragraph{Customer queues up remotely}
Gordon comes home from work at 5:30 PM. He would like to go to the store. He is a registered user of CLup. His smartphone has internet connection and GPS on. He opens the CLup mobile application and requests an immediate reservation to a store of his choice, selecting the car as means of transport. After some time he is alerted that he needs to depart to avoid being late at the store and losing the reservation. Pietro departs and arrives to the store. He opens the application and selects the reservation he created which now contains the number that represents his position in the queue. After some time the monitor outside the store shows his number, which means it is his turn to enter. He activates the turnstiles with the QR now shown in the reservation page of the mobile application and enters the store. He buys all the products he needs. He opens the application and selects the reservation he created which now contains a QR code. He activates the turnstiles and exits the store.
%TODO: be like Pietro
\paragraph{Customer queues up on premise}
Marco is an old man. He does not have a smartphone. He would like to go to the store next to his house on foot. He reaches the store, and retrieves a queue reservation ticket from the printer outside the store, by inserting his social security card. The ticket displays a QR code and a number that represents his position in queue. After some time the monitor outside the store shows his number, which means it is his turn to enter. He activates the turnstiles with the QR printed on his ticket and enters the store. He buys all the products he needs. He activates the turnstiles with his ticket and exits the store.
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The system cannot guarantee that a customer can enter a store at a precise time unless it requires users to exit after a maximum time (which it doesn't).
The system guarantees that if
%TODO: should those be domain assumptions?
\begin{itemize}
	\item the customer never disconnects from the internet and GPS
	\item the customer specified the correct means of transport when creating the reservation
\end{itemize}
 he/she will be alerted when he needs to depart to reach a store (in order not to be late) with a delay of at most 10 seconds.
\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The code should follow the requirements contained in this document, and be thoroughly commented.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The software the customer uses requires either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a smartphone to use the smart application
	\item a computer to use the web application and a home printer to print reservation
\end{itemize}
The software the store owner uses requires both:
\begin{itemize}
	\item turnstiles activated by QR
	\item reservation printer activated by social security card
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
Customers cannot have more than three active reservation requests for different stores and more than one for the same store.
\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system must have an appropriate infrastructure with a full backup system located in an separate office distant at least 100km (nuclear fallout radius). Adequate personnel will guarantee recovery time to substitute faulty hardware.
\subsubsection{Availability}
The system should be up for 99\% of the time (3.65 MTTR) since its temporary downtime does not cause emergency situations. The system is fully automated. The users are alerted about system downtime with a delay of at most 10 minutes. The users are alerted that the system is up again with a delay of at most 10 minutes.
\subsubsection{Security}
The location of customers is sensitive information and therefore is never stored. Customers and store owners provide identifying information during registration: the databases containing such information must be protected against internal and external attacks. Communication between central system and users is encrypted.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system is easy to maintain: its code is thoroughly commented and modular. Appropriate design patterns are exploited.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The smartphone application runs under Android and iOS. The web application runs under Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS.
